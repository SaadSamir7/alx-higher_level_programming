# 0x0C. Python - Almost a Circle

This project dives into various aspects of Python, aligning with the Higher-Level curriculum's AirBnB project. It's a comprehensive exploration covering Python fundamentals and advanced topics. The tasks cover:

- Import
- Exceptions
- Classes
- Private attributes
- Getter/Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file
- args and kwargs
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON

## Background Context

This project serves as preparation for the AirBnB project. It encapsulates a range of Python concepts, encompassing everything from basic imports to more advanced topics like serialization, deserialization, and unit testing.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you're expected to proficiently explain:

- Unit testing and its implementation in larger projects
- Serialization and deserialization of a Class
- Writing and reading a JSON file
- Utilizing *args and **kwargs
- Handling named arguments in a function

## Copyright & Plagiarism

Original solutions meeting the learning objectives are required. Avoiding plagiarism is crucial, and any form of it will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- **Editors:** Allowed editors are vi, vim, and emacs.
- **Interpretation:** Files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- **Structure:** Ensure all files end with a new line and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Code Style:** Implement PEP8 style (pycodestyle version 2.8.*).
- **Execution:** All files must be executable.
- **Documentation:** Thoroughly document modules, classes, and functions.
- **Length Check:** File length will be tested using `wc`.

### Python Unit Tests

- **Editors:** Allowed editors are vi, vim, and emacs.
- **Structure:** Test files must be inside a 'tests' folder and follow a specific naming convention.
- **Testing:** Utilize the unittest module for testing, executed using specific commands.
