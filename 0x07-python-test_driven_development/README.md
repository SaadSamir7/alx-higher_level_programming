## Project Description

In this project, you will learn the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. TDD is a software development methodology where you write tests for your code before writing the actual code. This approach ensures that your code functions correctly and allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements.

### Project Details

- **Weight**: 1
- **Start Date**: Oct 25, 2023 7:00 PM
- **End Date**: Oct 31, 2023 7:00 PM
- **Checker Release Date**: Oct 31, 2023 7:00 PM
- An auto-review will be launched at the deadline.

### Concepts

For this project, you are expected to focus on the concept of "Never forget a test."

## Background Context

This project introduces a change in the intranet checks for Python projects:

- Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything.
- The intranet checks for Python projects won't be released before their first deadline to emphasize TDD and comprehensive test case coverage.
- Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to ensure no edge cases are overlooked.

## Resources

You are encouraged to read or watch the following resources to help you with this project:

- [doctest — Test interactive Python examples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) (until "26.2.3.7. Warnings" included)
- [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [Unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [Interactive and Non-interactive tests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#other-examples)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following:

**General**
- Why Python programming is awesome.
- What an interactive test is.
- Why tests are important.
- How to write Docstrings to create tests.
- How to write documentation for each module and function.
- What are the basic option flags to create tests.
- How to find edge cases.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your test files should end with a new line.
- All your test files should be inside a folder named `tests`.
- All your test files should be text files with the extension `.txt`.
- All your tests should be executed using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
- All your modules should have documentation (check with `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your functions should have documentation (check with `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)`).
- A documentation is not a simple word; it's a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified).
- Collaboration on test cases is encouraged, as the Checker checks for test coverage.
