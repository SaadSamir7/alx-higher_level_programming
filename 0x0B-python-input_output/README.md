## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**General:**

- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to open a file
- How to write text in a file
- How to read the full content of a file
- How to read a file line by line
- How to move the cursor in a file
- How to make sure a file is closed after using it
- What is and how to use the with statement
- What is JSON
- What is serialization
- What is deserialization
- How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
- How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure

## Copyright - Plagiarism

- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks yourself to meet the above learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

**Python Scripts:**

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

**Python Test Cases:**

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder named "tests"
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All your modules should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)`)
- A documentation is not a simple word; it’s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

Good luck with your project on Python Input/Output!
