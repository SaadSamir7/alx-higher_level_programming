## Description
This project is about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, focusing on classes and objects. You will learn the fundamentals of OOP, including classes, objects, attributes, methods, data encapsulation, and information hiding.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you will be able to:

* Understand the principles of Object-Oriented Programming.
* Differentiate between classes and objects.
* Define and use attributes in Python.
* Implement public, protected, and private attributes.
* Understand the purpose of the `self` parameter in methods.
* Work with the special `__init__` method.
* Learn about data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding.
* Define and use properties.
* Differentiate between attributes and properties in Python.
* Write getters and setters the Pythonic way.
* Dynamically create new attributes for class instances.
* Work with the `__dict__` of a class and its instances.
* Understand how Python finds object and class attributes.
* Use the `getattr` function in Python.

## Requirements
### General
* Editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
* All files should end with a new line.
* The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
* A README.md file, located at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
* Code must conform to PEP 8 style guide (using pycodestyle version 2.8.*).
* All files must be executable.
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
* Modules, classes, and functions should contain documentation in the form of docstrings.
* Documentation should be meaningful sentences explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.

## Project Files
* `0-rectangle.py`: Defines an empty class `Rectangle`.
* `1-rectangle.py`: Defines a class `Rectangle` with width and height attributes.
* `2-rectangle.py`: Adds area and perimeter methods to the `Rectangle` class.
* `3-rectangle.py`: Improves the `Rectangle` class by adding string representation.
* `4-rectangle.py`: Adds a `repr()` method to the `Rectangle` class.
* `5-square.py`: Defines a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle`.
* `6-square.py`: Adds a `position` attribute and updates string representation for `Square`.
* `100-singly_linked_list.py`: Defines a `Node` class for singly linked lists.
* `101-square.py`: Defines a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle`.
* `102-square.py`: Adds comparison methods to the `Square` class.
* `103-magic_class.py`: Represents a Python bytecode class.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Execute the Python files as needed.

Example:
```bash
./0-rectangle.py
